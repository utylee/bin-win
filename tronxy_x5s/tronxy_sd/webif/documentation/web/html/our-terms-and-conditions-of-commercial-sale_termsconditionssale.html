OFFER, CONFIRMATION OR AGREEMENT</h3><p>These Terms and Conditions apply to and form an integral part of:</p><ul><li>a.	all quotations and offers (hereinafter both referred to as “Offer”) of Seller to Buyer,</li><li>b.	all acceptances, acknowledgements or confirmations by Seller (hereinafter all referred to as “Confirmation”) of any order of Buyer, including without limitation orders of Buyer resulting from any pricing or other framework agreement between any Buyer and Seller, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing between Seller and Buyer,</li><li>c.	any agreement resulting from such Offer or Confirmation, and</li><li>d.	any agreement incorporating these Terms and Conditions by reference (both types of agreements referred to under Sections 1(c) and 1(d) shall hereinafter be referred to as an “Agreement”),</li><ul><p>regarding the sale by Seller and purchase by Buyer of goods (“Products”), unless Seller explicitly agrees in writing to the exclusion hereof.</p><p>These Terms and Conditions shall constitute all of the terms and conditions of any Offer, Confirmation and Agreement between Seller and Buyer relating to the sale by Seller and purchase by Buyer of Products.  Any terms and conditions set forth on any document or documents issued by Buyer (including “Pull Documents” as defined below) either before or after issuance of any document by Seller setting forth or referring to these Terms and Conditions are hereby explicitly rejected and disregarded by Seller, and any such document shall be wholly inapplicable to any sale made by Seller and shall not be binding in any way on Seller.  No Offer, Confirmation or Agreement constitutes an acceptance by Seller of any other terms and conditions, and Seller does not intend to enter into an agreement other than under these Terms and Conditions.</p><p>Any Offer is expressly made conditional on Buyer's assent to all of the terms contained in the Offer without deviation. Acceptance by Buyer of an Offer may be evidenced by (i) Buyer's written or verbal assent or the written or verbal assent of any representative of Buyer, (ii) Buyer's acceptance of delivery of the Products or payment of purchase price for the first installment of the Products (if applicable), or any such acceptance by any representative of Buyer, or (iii) other conduct by Buyer or any representative of Buyer consistent with acceptance of the Offer.</p><p>In the event that any Offer or Confirmation is sent in response to Buyer's blanket purchase order, the terms and conditions of that Offer or Confirmation, including these Terms and Conditions, shall apply to any “pull” by Buyer or delivery by Seller, irrespective of whether Buyer submits additional purchase orders (electronically or otherwise) (“Pull Documents”) and whether Seller provides a Confirmation to such additional purchase orders. All terms and conditions of such Pull Documents are hereby rejected.</p><p>Seller’s Offers are open for acceptance within the period stated by Seller in the Offer or, when no period is stated, within thirty (30) days from the date of the Offer, but any Offer may be withdrawn or revoked by Seller at any time prior to the receipt by Seller of Buyer's acceptance related thereto.</p><p>If Seller receives an order from Buyer for the sale by Seller and purchase by Buyer of Products and such order is not a response to an Offer by Seller, or if Seller receives an order or acceptance by Buyer which deviates from Seller's Offer, such order or acceptance, respectively, shall be deemed to be a request for an Offer only.</p><p>An acceptance by Buyer of any Offer made by an order gatherer, liaison officer, agent or sales representative for Seller shall constitute an Agreement between Seller and Buyer upon explicit Confirmation by Seller itself.</p><p>In these Terms and Conditions, the term “Affiliate(s)” shall mean any corporation or other legal entity that a party now or hereafter Controls, is Controlled by or is under common Control with; where “Control” means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the shares or similar interests entitled to vote for the election of directors or other persons performing similar functions.  An entity may be considered an Affiliate only when such Control exists.  Seller and its Affiliates are individually and/or collectively referred to herein as “NXP”.</p><h3>2.   PRODUCTS, QUANTITIES AND PRICING</h3><p>Prices in any Offer, Confirmation or Agreement are in United States Dollars and do not include any taxes, duties or similar levies, now or hereafter enacted, applicable to the Products.  Seller will add taxes, duties and similar levies to the sales price where Seller is required by law to pay or collect them and will be paid by Buyer together with the price.</p><p>With regard to Custom Products (as defined in Section 6 below) Seller may deliver a quantity that is a maximum amount of ten percent (10%) more or less than the ordered quantity of any order line item. Such delivered quantity will be accepted and paid for (against an amount being the actual delivered quantity times the unit price) in full satisfaction of each party's obligation under the Agreement for the quantity ordered.</p><h3>3.   RIGHTS IN SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3><p>Unless provided otherwise in a separate agreement between Seller and Buyer, the following terms apply to software (including firmware in all references to “software”, unless stated otherwise) and documentation provided or made available to Buyer in connection with Products:</p><p>Seller grants Buyer a nonexclusive license to use and distribute software in machine-readable form, only in combination with or as part of the Product for which the software has been provided and only one copy for each such Product.  No rights or licenses with respect to any software source code are granted to Buyer.  Seller grants Buyer a nonexclusive license to use and distribute non-confidential documentation with the Product for which the documentation has been provided and only one copy for each such Product.  Buyer will reproduce all of Seller’s (or its licensor’s) copyright notices and other proprietary legends in the software and on copies thereof.</p><p>With respect to Products, software, documentation, and portions thereof, Buyer is not authorized to and agrees that it will not: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, ideas, technology or algorithms, except to the extent expressly authorized by statutory law; (ii) modify or create derivative works; (iii) remove or alter any proprietary markings or notices; or (iv) merge, link or incorporate software into any other software.  Should Buyer create any modifications or derivative works of Products, software, documentation or a portion thererof, Buyer irrevocably assigns and agrees to assign all right, title and interest in any such modifications or derivative works to Seller.  Buyer's rights under these Terms and Conditions are conditional upon Buyer not performing any actions that may require any software, Products and/or any derivative work thereof, to be licensed under open source software license terms that may, for example, require disclosing source code, granting a license under intellectual property rights, such as granting a permission to develop derivative works, or granting other rights or assuming responsibilities commonly associated with open source software.</p><p>If Buyer is in default of any of the terms herein, Buyer’s license to software and documentation will automatically terminate.  Buyer shall indemnify NXP against and hold NXP harmless from any damage or costs arising from or in connection with any violation or breach of the provisions of this Section 3 and Buyer shall reimburse all costs and expenses incurred by NXP in defending any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from or in connection with such violation or breach.</p><p>To the extent that software and/or documentation is embedded in a Product, the sale of such Product shall not constitute the transfer of ownership rights or title in such software and/or documentation, and all references to “sale” or “sold” of any software or documentation shall be deemed to mean a license.  Except for those rights specifically granted in this Section 3 in connection with software and documentation:  (i) NXP and its suppliers reserve all right, title and interest, together with all intellectual property rights thereto, in all software and documentation provided or made available to Buyer, and (ii) no other express or implied license, right or interest in or to any patent, patent application, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, service mark or any other intellectual property right is granted hereunder.</p><p>Any open source software included in the software is not licensed or warranted under the terms of these Terms and Conditions, but is instead licensed under the terms of applicable open source license(s), such as the BSD License, Apache License or the Lesser GNU General Public License.  In no event will Buyer subject the software to an Excluded License.  An Excluded License means any license that requires, as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution of software subject to the Excluded License, that such software or other software combined and/or distributed with such software be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.  Buyer is solely responsible for obtaining any necessary third party approvals and any licenses for any necessary essential patents for their use in connection with technology that Buyer incorporates into Buyer’s system or software (whether as part of the software or not).</p><p>Neither the sale of any of the Products, nor these Terms and Conditions, shall be construed as conferring any right, license or immunity:</p><ul><li>a.	under any intellectual property rights to any combination, machine, or process in which Products might be used, or to any modifications of Products, software, or documentation;</li><li>b.	with respect to any trademark, trade or brand name, corporate name, or any other name or mark, or contraction, abbreviation or simulation thereof;</li><li>c.	under any intellectual property rights covering an industry standard set by a standard setting body or agreed to between at least two companies; or</li><li>d.	under any intellectual property rights with respect to which NXP has informed Buyer or has published a statement that a separate license has to be obtained or that no license is granted or implied.</li></ul><h3>4.   PAYMENT</h3><ul><li>a.	Unless agreed otherwise between Seller and Buyer in writing, Seller may invoice Buyer for the price of the Products delivered upon delivery of the Products in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Net payment is due within thirty (30) days of date of invoice unless agreed otherwise between Seller and Buyer in writing.  All payments shall be made to the designated Seller's address.  If deliveries are made in installments, each installment may be separately invoiced and shall be paid for when due.  No discount is allowed for early payment unless agreed to in writing by Seller.  Interest will accrue on all late payments, at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, from the due date until payment in full.</li><li>b.	All deliveries and performance of work agreed to by Seller shall at all times be subject to credit approval of Seller.  If, in Seller's judgment, Buyer's financial condition at any time does not justify production, performance of work or delivery on the above payment terms, Seller may require full or partial payment in advance or other payment terms as condition for delivery, and Seller may suspend, delay or cancel any credit, delivery or any other performance by Seller.</li><li>c.	Payment by Buyer of non-recurring charges (as may be made to Seller for special design, engineering work or production materials) shall not convey title to any design, engineering work or production materials, and title shall remain in Seller.</li><li>d.	Buyer shall not offset, withhold or reduce any payment(s) due by it to Seller.  The payment of fees and charges is a covenant of Buyer that is independent of the other covenants made by the parties hereunder.</li><li>e.	If Seller incurs exchange rate losses due to Buyer's failure to pay when payments are due, Seller shall be entitled to equivalent compensation from Buyer for such losses.</li><li>f.	In the event of any default by Buyer in the payment of any fees or charges due, or any other default by Buyer, Seller shall have the right to refuse performance of any work and delivery of any Products until payments are brought current and Seller may suspend, delay or cancel any credit, delivery or any other performance by Seller.  Such right shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available under these Terms and Conditions or at law or in equity.</li></ul><h3>5.
