<a name="whatis"></a>

<h2>What is OpenCores.ORG?</h2>

<p>
    OpenCores is a community that enable engineers to develop open source 
    hardware, with a similar ethos to the free software movement. Currently 
    the emphasis is on digital modules called 'cores'  or 'IP Cores'. 
    All activities is centered around the OpenCores web site
    http://opencores.org 
</p>
<p>
    There is no formal affiliation between the people contribute to OpenCores.
    They are a bunch of people who just happen to be walking in the same 
    direction along a road. This is a dynamic group, people regularly join 
    and leave. The group today contains of both private individuals as well 
    commercial individuals.
</p>

<a name="purpose"></a>

<h2>What is the purpose of this FAQ?</h2>

<p>
    This FAQ covers all aspects of OpenCores. Use it as the
    starting point for any FAQ you have. If an aspect of
    OpenCores maintains their own FAQ, this FAQ will make
    the appropriate referral.
</p>

<a name="nomatch"></a>

<h2>My question is not covered in the FAQ, what do I do?</h2>

<p>
    If your question id not covered in the FAQ, email us your 
    question (oc-team@opencores.org).
    You can also post your question on the forum, please use the 
    "others"-forum for generic questions.
</p>


<a name="whycontribute"></a>

<h2>Why do people contribute to OpenCores?</h2>

<p>
    A strong reason to release a core as open source is to get help with the
    verification. And since the verification is a major part within a
    development project today (~80-90%), this provides a win-win partnership
    between the original designer and the end-users.
</p>
<p>
    The open source methodology is the only way we can drive the technology to
    the next level in a cost efficient way, since we share the huge verification
    effort with the whole open source community.
</p>

<a name="whocontributes"></a>

<h2>Who contributes to OpenCores?</h2>

<p>
    All kinds of people: Students, HW Professionals, SW Professionals,
    Companies, Hobby engineers, Universities, etc. We need all kinds of people
    contributing with all kinds of different skills.
</p>

<a name="whereisit"></a>

<h2>Where is OpenCores situated?</h2>

<p>
    The main server is physically located in Sweden, Europe. 
</p>

<a name="history"></a>

<h2>History of OpenCores</h2>

<p>
    OpenCores was founded in October 1999, by Damjan Lampret, as an open source
    community for development and distribution of VHDL/Verilog IP cores
    (building blocks of Semiconductor chips). OpenCores soon became world wide
    known by ASIC and FPGA engineers. 
</p>

<a name="canyouhelp"></a>

<h2>Can you help me with my school/college/university project?</h2>

<p>
    In general, no. If you start exploiting opencores to get a
    school project done, others will rapidly tire of your questions
    and ignore you. Having said this, many people contribute to
    opencores in order to teach and learn. You can learn a lot
    from opencores. This knowledge will make you a better designer
    and indirectly help with any student projects you may have to do.
    Valid ways to learn include contributing to an opencores project,
    or running your own opencores project. Any questions directly
    related to a school project should be directed towards your
    supervisor at school.
</p>

<a name="whatlanguage"></a>

<h2>What language is spoken on the forums/mailing lists?</h2>

<p>
    The official language for the opencores forums/mailing-lists and web site is
    English. A subset of pages are translated to Chinese.
</p>

<a name="spam"></a>

<h2>Is advertising or SPAM allowed on the forum/mailing-lists?</h2>

<p>
    No. OpenCores reserves the right to charge for advertising or SPAM sent to
    any mailing list.
</p>

<a name="designlanguage"></a>

<h2>What design language do you use?</h2>

<p>
    There is no preferred language and each designer uses their language of
    choice. Keep in mind that a core written in a seldom used language will not
    be very useful. Most designers use VHDL, Verilog, SystemVerilog.
</p>

<a name="socbus"></a>

<h2>What is the preferred System-On-A-Chip (SoC) bus for OpenCores?</h2>

<p>
    The preferred bus is WISHBONE. This is the only commonly used SoC bus which
    is truly free. Rudolf Usselmann has analysed the advantages of the common
    SoC busses. His report is available at the "Wishbone"-page.
    The Wishbone specification is today maintained jointly between 
    Michael Unnebäck and Richard Herveille.
</p>

<a name="anyguidelines"></a>

<h2>Does OpenCores have any coding and interface guidelines?</h2>

<p>
    The OpenCores RTL coding guidelines are available <a href="http://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/opencores_coding_guidelines.pdf">here</a></p>

<a name="whatlicense"></a>

<h2>What license is used for OpenCores?</h2>

<p>
    To simplify life for users, developers are strongly encouraged to use an
    unmodified LGPL (Lesser GPL) license or the modified-BSD license. The
    modified-BSD license is the original BSD license with the 'advertising
    clause' removed. 
</p>
<p>
    A modified-BSD style license essentially states that no warranty is given,
    the core may be distributed in source or binary form and the authors
    copyright must be acknowledged. 
</p>
<p>
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_BSD_licence 
</p>
<p>
    The GNU Lesser General Public License (formerly the GNU Library General
    Public License) or LGPL is a free software license published by the Free
    Software Foundation (FSF). It was designed as a compromise between the
    strong-copyleft GNU General Public License or GPL and permissive licenses
    such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License. The GNU Lesser General Public
    License was written in 1991 (and updated in 1999, and again in 2007) by
    Richard Stallman, with legal advice from Eben Moglen.

</p>

<a name="allprojects"></a>

<h2>Where can I see all projects/cores?</h2>

<p>
    Select the “Projects”-link on the first page. Here is a list of all the available projects at OpenCores. 
</p>

<a name="sourceforcore"></a>

<h2>How do I get the source for a core?</h2>

<p>
    There are two main ways to download the code for a project:
</p>
<p>
    1. Via the website: <br />
    The latest version of the source-code for each project can be 
    downloaded via the “Project-list” by selecting the “download”-button.
</p>
<p>
    2. Via SVN client: <br />
    Using a SVN client enables full access to the source-code and all 
    its history. Instructions how to download (checkout) and 
    upload (checkin) are available here the “SVN HowTo”-link at 
    the first page.
</p>

<a name="contributemore"></a>

<h2>How can I contribute?</h2>

<p>
    There are lots of ways to contribute, without running your own project. This
    includes helping with an existing project, both with development and with verification.
    Helping us improving the web site, or whatever you find interesting. Documentation and
    testing are especially appreciated. If this sounds interesting, please send
    an email to oc-team@opencores.org or the project maintainers directly. 
</p>

<a name="projectis"></a>

<h2>What is a project?</h2>

<p>
    A project is basically a "unit of work". It can be every thing from a smaller function 
   (an adder) all the way up to complex function (a processor). Each project has 
    one of more maintainers. 
    The maintainer/s are persons who has volunteered to oversee the development and to 
    make sure that the project gets updated with feedback from the community. 
    Typically each project corresponds to a single core. 
</p>
<p>
    Each project has its own web page, SVN-repository, statistic-information and bugtracker. 
    To see the page for a project, click on the "Projects"-link under the "Browse"-menu 
    on the left side of page. You will be presented with a list of projects. 
    Click on the name of a project to see its pages.
</p>

<a name="howtohelp"></a>

<h2>How do I help out on an existing project?</h2>

<a name="howtostart"></a>

<h2>How do I start my own project?</h2>

<p>
    Start by getting an account on OpenCores (as described above). 
    Before requesting a new project, check if there are any other projects 
    similar to the one you want to start. If there is, consider joining that 
    project before starting a new one. It better to have one really good project, 
    then having ten similar projects. Working together will improve 
    efficiency and quality.
</p>
<p>
    To start a new project, select the "create project"-link under "My account"-page. 
</p>
<p>
    Please do not set up a project simply to point to files outside 
    the OpenCores server. We have had so much problems in the past when these external 
    links disappears after a while. If all files are located at in OpenCores 
    SVN repositories then we can avoid this problem. All files must be located 
    on the OpenCores server.

<h2>I don't want to maintain a project any more. What do I do?</h2>

<p>
    If you decide to stop working on a project, please send mail
    to oc-team@opencores.org. We will then announce the project as unmaintained and 
    ask if anyone within the community want to "take over" the maintainership.
</p>

<h2>The original maintainers are not contactable, can I become a co-maintainer 
    and continue to develop and maintain the project?
</h2>

<p>
    Yes, we will then try a final time to contact the original maintainers and if 
    they don't answer within 1-2 weeks, then we can add you as a co-maintainer. 
    To request this, send an email to oc-team@opencores.org
</p>

<h2>I have written a core. Can I publish it on the OpenCores web site?</h2>

<p>
    Yes absolutely, this is the main function of OpenCores. Start reading this 
    section at the beginning. Read the "How do I start my own project" section 
    in this FAQ.

<h2>I have an idea for a core, but need help to develop it.</h2>

<p>
    Send mail to the "cores"-forum", describing the project and
    asking for help. Someone may be interested enough to participate in your 
    project. It much better to be several maintainers in a project, both from 
    a technical stand point and it more fun to have "partners" to discuss with 
    during development. The source for any work developed will have to be 
    released to the rest of OpenCores under a free or open license.

    address that was used during the registration.
