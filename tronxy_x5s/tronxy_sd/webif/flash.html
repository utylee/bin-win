        <p> Smoothie no longer stores the web interface in the firmware, but now uses the SD card instead </p>
        <p> It looks like your SD card came without the interfaces, but you updated your firmware to the most recent version, which does not contain the interfaces either </p>
        <p> Installing the interfaces on your SD card is very easy, for instructions, please follow <a href="http://smoothieware.org/missing-web-interface"> this link </a> </p>
        <p> If you are connected to the internet, you can also find the web interfaces without installing them by accessing them online <a href="http://smoothieware.github.io/Webif-pack/"> here <a></p>
        <p> Thank you ! </p>
